    <text start="22.949" dur="4.82">Thursday this week&amp;#39;s tea comes from Trisha Paytas. I&amp;#39;m about five weeks late on this</text>
    <text start="27.77" dur="3.869">It was one of those things where you see in your peripheral you like. I don&amp;#39;t really care about that</text>
    <text start="31.77" dur="3.38">But then the more you look into it, you&amp;#39;re like Jesus Christ that&amp;#39;s a full blown panda!</text>
    <text start="35.73" dur="6.799">And that&amp;#39;s about it with Trisha Paytas. And sadly I couldn&amp;#39;t be a Teletubby, but you know what? I became one</text>
    <text start="44" dur="1.2">I am one.</text>
    <text start="48.5" dur="3">I&amp;#39;m a mother[frick]ing Teletubby</text>

    <text start="55.22" dur="1.819">Teletubby is not one of them.</text>
    <text start="57.039" dur="1.461">Liar manipulator</text>
    <text start="58.68" dur="1.559">playing victim</text>
    <text start="60.239" dur="2.54">aggressive abusive not a Teletubby</text>
    <text start="63.36" dur="1.649">So what has she done recently?</text>
    <text start="65.009" dur="7.01">Well a couple things two things I knew about Trisha from this god forbidden video called showering with my boyfriend</text>
    <text start="72.14" dur="5.36">Whatever you do do not watch this video. It&amp;#39;s a cursed video. [I don&amp;#39;t know buddy]</text>
    <text start="79.16" dur="4.86">Just don&amp;#39;t watch this video me with my sleep paralysis demon</text>
    <text start="84.14" dur="4.5">To whoever was the cameraman we send a deep prayer to you</text>
    <text start="88.64" dur="6.96">Trisha has been wheezing her way in in different ways where I hope that I would never see her again after that video</text>
    <text start="95.6" dur="5.309">She&amp;#39;s been part of the david dobrik vlogs. She&amp;#39;s been doing her regulars Spiel of crying</text>
    <text start="104.729" dur="2">Almost as good as me crying in my car</text>
    <text start="112.02" dur="5.419">But recently she got there in a bit the drama with Nikocado Avocado</text>
    <text start="117.439" dur="6.06">Do you want to lose some brain cells? Great keep watching you see Trisha Paytas had the competition</text>
    <text start="124.11" dur="5.509">For who would make a cover of her song and Nikocado Avocado made a beautiful song</text>
    <text start="142.569" dur="5.63">It&amp;#39;s actually not bad I didn&amp;#39;t know you had any other talent but crying about who God knows what while eating</text>
    <text start="148.81" dur="2">Did you send a hotel room?</text>
    <text start="153.5" dur="1.37">What the f*ck is this!?</text>
    <text start="154.87" dur="2.119">When you give up on your talent and dreams</text>
    <text start="157.75" dur="3.08">Mukbang. Yeah, Trisha saw this cover that</text>
    <text start="161.349" dur="6.77">Nicodo Avocado did of her video and she be like I have loved you for so long as a fan and this blew</text>
    <text start="168.12" dur="5.399">My mind when I saw it in the subscription, so she was subscribed even we need to get together in person</text>
    <text start="173.62" dur="3.979">There is something about you and then this I&amp;#39;m speechless</text>
    <text start="178.329" dur="5.42">Truly, I can&amp;#39;t think of the right words to say and then she tweets him going like hey, babe</text>
    <text start="183.75" dur="5.669">Where do you live we need to collab. Love ASAP. Your uh never brought tears. DM</text>
    <text start="189.489" dur="4.639">What relevance does this have to anything Felix? Well, I&amp;#39;ll have you know that Trisha</text>
    <text start="194.68" dur="6.139">Invited him to collab he flew all the way from Colombia and she just ghosted him. Uh-huh</text>
    <text start="201.129" dur="5.03">Okay, so Trisha Paytas right now. I&amp;#39;ve been watching you for a few months. I just adore you</text>
    <text start="206.16" dur="3.029">I don&amp;#39;t know if you&amp;#39;ve seen my videos about not one to be vegan anymore</text>
    <text start="209.19" dur="2.519">But it would be so fun to eat something non vegan with you</text>
    <text start="212.68" dur="2">She respond. Hell yeah</text>
    <text start="215.049" dur="7.58">Actually, I&amp;#39;m pretty free next week. What day are you thinking? I said, I&amp;#39;m free on next week - I just do YouTube</text>
    <text start="222.63" dur="3.359">That&amp;#39;s a super flexible so you can pick the day. I&amp;#39;m looking at flights now</text>
    <text start="226.48" dur="3.08">So I let her know I&amp;#39;m flying I said I&amp;#39;m looking at the flights</text>
    <text start="229.81" dur="3.199">I&amp;#39;ll let her know are you available but she says I&amp;#39;m free all week</text>
    <text start="233.01" dur="4.86">I said I&amp;#39;ve never been to California before the best flight deal is Tuesday the 17th then</text>
    <text start="238.389" dur="4.64">She responds I can make that work. I can make that work. Hi, Trisha</text>
    <text start="243.03" dur="3.63">I came to LA to see ya but I don&amp;#39;t know how to get a whole. Yeah, is everything okay?</text>
    <text start="246.66" dur="3.899">Next one says if I did something wrong he let me know I have gifts from you from Colombia</text>
    <text start="250.59" dur="4.889">He brought gifts from Colombia. This is opposed to be cringe. We&amp;#39;re getting into the cringe</text>
    <text start="255.48" dur="3.08">The cringe is bad area if it has meaning behind it, okay?</text>
    <text start="258.56" dur="3.209">But the best part about this, is that even though Trisha clearly</text>
    <text start="261.87" dur="6.86">Publicly said that she subscribed to him watch his videos and wanted to collab with him on mine. There&amp;#39;s a different story</text>
    <text start="274.65" dur="6.74">I was never going to I wasn&amp;#39;t gonna like collab. You heard a meanie. I don&amp;#39;t know where that came from your text message</text>
    <text start="284.7" dur="3.529">Where that come from and I was like they were all like Trisha goes to him</text>
    <text start="288.23" dur="3.959">I was like Trisha didn&amp;#39;t even know that he was coming no idea no idea</text>
    <text start="292.23" dur="1.95">No, I dad don&amp;#39;t like all that</text>
    <text start="294.18" dur="6.71">The only thing I heard of him wasn&amp;#39;t he did my warrior cover you said you were subscribed in the comments of that video?</text>
    <text start="301.35" dur="3.829">The only thing I heard of him was what he did my warrior brah. Well, I thank you</text>
    <text start="305.18" dur="4.86">So many people him and a lot of your fans want to hear an apology. I&amp;#39;m not sorry</text>
    <text start="311.22" dur="3.17">I feel like you don&amp;#39;t know anyway anything you really know can you acknowledge that?</text>
    <text start="315.39" dur="1.68">ghosting him</text>
    <text start="317.07" dur="2">was rude I</text>
    <text start="319.23" dur="2.209">Don&amp;#39;t I don&amp;#39;t think it&amp;#39;s not really?</text>
    <text start="323.22" dur="3.529">You know you&amp;#39;re messed up big time if Paris Hilton is the voice of reason</text>
    <text start="326.75" dur="3.63">I don&amp;#39;t know what you want me to say like I&amp;#39;m not gonna pawn as this person is like</text>
    <text start="331.62" dur="4.429">Like, you know what? I mean? Like there&amp;#39;s something like a little off here asked he lied</text>
    <text start="336.05" dur="5.4">I didn&amp;#39;t I felt harassed by him. That was it was still insane. It was so insane. It&amp;#39;s so scary to me</text>
    <text start="343.2" dur="4.099">So then she just completely changed the story because you know, Trisha can&amp;#39;t be the bad person</text>
    <text start="347.58" dur="3.5">The reason why she goes to him was she was scared of him. That&amp;#39;s right</text>
    <text start="351.36" dur="4.94">because Naqada avocado had a thumbnail where he had a knife and said I had enough and</text>
    <text start="357.18" dur="6.05">She&amp;#39;s just scared of him. So now that we know that she&amp;#39;s not a good person. It&amp;#39;s okay to make fun of her. Yeah</text>
    <text start="364.26" dur="4.519">The next stop came from H Street Street where I followed this it was really funny</text>
    <text start="369" dur="5.839">Basically Ethan did a video calling out the Instagram versus reality subreddit where you have pictures like this</text>
    <text start="374.84" dur="3.45">I actually wanted to make a video in this my my eye. That&amp;#39;s too high</text>
    <text start="378.29" dur="2.729">I&amp;#39;m not touching that someone&amp;#39;s gonna lash out lo and behold</text>
    <text start="381.72" dur="3.019">Trisha Paytas saw that video cuz she was in it</text>
    <text start="384.74" dur="4.5">I can&amp;#39;t even tell him is any of these Trisha Peters like honestly cannot help there</text>
    <text start="390.82" dur="3.799">Why do you why are you even a model if you&amp;#39;re gonna modify your looks that much</text>
    <text start="394.62" dur="6.66">It&amp;#39;s like from beauty queen to WWF wrestler in two seconds. You cannot Foix up your heart and soul</text>
    <text start="401.8" dur="4.1">Remember that this girl tried to use a face filter on Instagram and her phone blew up</text>
    <text start="409.33" dur="4.7">She is the best isn&amp;#39;t she not the best would people even recognize her if they saw her on the street</text>
    <text start="414.03" dur="4.949">I mean, I mean to be afraid you probably do this with almost anyone probably not to the same extreme</text>
    <text start="418.979" dur="2.76">But you can take a photo. There&amp;#39;s no ugly photos of me</text>
    <text start="421.74" dur="4.649">However, but over someone else you could take an ugly photo and then like a BAM photo and be like, yeah</text>
    <text start="426.43" dur="3.83">This is Coachella verse throwing down in the McDonald&amp;#39;s parking lot at 3 a.m</text>
    <text start="430.93" dur="2.179">Chella vs. WorldStarHipHop. Oh</text>
    <text start="435.22" dur="6.29">That cannot be the same person to Coachella versus open-casket funeral</text>
    <text start="441.91" dur="2.329">So, how did Trish I responded to this video?</text>
    <text start="444.24" dur="7.529">Of course, she had the most eloquent thought-out response that really put Ethan to place please Allah Cline h3</text>
    <text start="451.77" dur="5.79">Do not raise your child to be as ignorant as your husband. I would divorce him ASAP</text>
    <text start="458.919" dur="3.26">As he is causing so much damage to young women</text>
    <text start="462.75" dur="2.849">It&amp;#39;s basically second act. I never been more</text>
    <text start="466.15" dur="2.54">Disgusted I think that&amp;#39;s pretty fair. Just tweeting</text>
    <text start="468.69" dur="7.5">Someone&amp;#39;s pregnant wife how to race their child and to leave their husband Jesus Christ. Could you have been any more gross about it?</text>
    <text start="476.19" dur="5.519">I wasn&amp;#39;t gonna say anything but obviously when people attack ela it&amp;#39;s mask off and I saw her profile pic and I go</text>
    <text start="481.96" dur="3.86">Who was this rude person? I don&amp;#39;t recognize her from her profile picture</text>
    <text start="485.82" dur="4.889">Does anyone know her she then made a video at 6:00 in the morning sitting on the kitchen floor?</text>
    <text start="491.139" dur="0.71">[Hey guys</text>
    <text start="491.849" dur="4.65">What is up it is] Pewds: and then she even admits to not even having to watch his video [big</text>
    <text start="496.63" dur="2.419">platform and like shaving these women like .. *sniffles*</text>
    <text start="501.01" dur="5.359">I-I did fast-forward to my part, I don&amp;#39;t really watch the other people he talked about Chloe and then right after me] Jesus Christ</text>
    <text start="506.88" dur="5.489">I felt like Ethan&amp;#39;s video. Yeah, it was making fun of people. Obviously that&amp;#39;s a sensitive topic</text>
    <text start="512.37" dur="0.96">I get it</text>
    <text start="513.33" dur="6.629">but I think it&amp;#39;s worth criticizing these things where Instagram has just become this staple of how people compare themselves to</text>
    <text start="520.419" dur="4.289">They look on these insanely retouched photos or edited photos and be like, okay</text>
    <text start="524.709" dur="1.421">Why do I not look like that?</text>
    <text start="526.13" dur="5.659">When the reality is actually quite different and I think that&amp;#39;s a lot more damaging than making fun of it</text>
    <text start="532.1" dur="2.059">[don&amp;#39;t need a beep beep like that down like</text>
    <text start="541.37" dur="6.559">The reason I post those ugly photos next to eight pretty photos] wait, so she&amp;#39;s the one that posed these photos</text>
    <text start="547.929" dur="1.451">*laughs*</text>
    <text start="549.56" dur="2.24">She&amp;#39;s the one that- she&amp;#39;s the source</text>
    <text start="552.32" dur="5.449">Other people can&amp;#39;t laugh at it though. [Cuz I do it, I always want girls to know that like it&amp;#39;s okay to like</text>
    <text start="558.8" dur="3.38">Be like this.] This was Ethan&amp;#39;s message as well</text>
    <text start="562.6" dur="5.64">That&amp;#39;s literally what he said if you had watched the damn video instead of lashing out on his wife Jesus Christ</text>
    <text start="568.24" dur="5.039">Dude, now Trisha Paytas has done some pretty funny things. She said some pretty great stuff</text>
    <text start="573.279" dur="7.53">I feel like she does play into the dumb blonde role like she purposely try and make her stupid [dogs are and are a...</text>
    <text start="581.63" dur="1.29">mammals....</text>
    <text start="582.92" dur="4.729">Right? Yeah dogs are mammals. They&amp;#39;re humans or no. They&amp;#39;re not human. They&amp;#39;re part of the animal</text>
    <text start="588.23" dur="3.979">Kingdom that God created I love you Jesus.] That is an amazing sentence</text>
    <text start="594.16" dur="2.08">[Yeah, dogs are mammals they&amp;#39;re humans]</text>
    <text start="596.24" dur="5.1">dogs are human no, they&amp;#39;re not human they&amp;#39;re part of the animal kingdom that God created</text>
    <text start="601.34" dur="1.7">I love you, Jesus.</text>
    <text start="603.04" dur="1.66">AAAAAAAAAAAAHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH</text>

    <text start="733.319" dur="3.71">So anyone that says real and fake is fake</text>
    <text start="737.699" dur="5.479">Anyone says I&amp;#39;m so real other people are fake. They&amp;#39;re hundred percent fake. I never if there&amp;#39;s no exception to that rule</text>
    <text start="743.789" dur="2.66">for those of you the less is filty and</text>
    <text start="747.809" dur="5.809">Bitch, I&amp;#39;m not doing real. I like a fucking talk about everything like you didn&amp;#39;t even knew half the shit that these youtubers talk about</text>
    <text start="754.499" dur="5.78">Another one night you today? I genuinely do I ain&amp;#39;t perfect. But I love the sub dummies and I can&amp;#39;t</text>

    <text start="767.58" dur="6.86">Do whatever I can&amp;#39;t chew in over my head anymore. I look at this. Oh my god, Trish. Do you remember?</text>
    <text start="781.74" dur="2">Goddamnit</text>
    <text start="787.44" dur="6.049">Okay, that is about as much as I can stomach for cringe Tuesday&amp;#39;s that&amp;#39;s stricture paid us everyone</text>
    <text start="793.49" dur="5.7">I&amp;#39;m sorry for bringing this to light. I feel like Trisha belongs in this category of youtubers. I just have no shame</text>
    <text start="799.26" dur="4.909">It&amp;#39;s like the mukbang videos. No one wants to watch those videos. You might say</text>
    <text start="804.17" dur="5.28">Oh, well, some people like them sure like what 2% of people that&amp;#39;s not the reason they exist there</text>
    <text start="809.49" dur="3.169">They&amp;#39;re flashy thumbnail and people are grossed out by them</text>
    <text start="812.66" dur="5.429">People don&amp;#39;t want to see that people are outraged about them this kind of content that no one wants to see it&amp;#39;s kind of content</text>
    <text start="818.09" dur="6.809">Where you&amp;#39;re crying on camera deliberately, which I would never go. Just whatever it takes to get views on YouTube. There&amp;#39;s no shame whatsoever</text>
    <text start="825.3" dur="5.15">But Trisha is the exception of at the same time just being insanely</text>
    <text start="831.09" dur="4.4">Insecure which is not a good combination. She does have some likeable qualities though like</text>
    <text start="838.08" dur="2">She&amp;#39;s....uh...*claps*</text>
    <text start="847.89" dur="3.049">What you never played super simulator</text>
    <text start="852.45" dur="2">You know, it&amp;#39;s fun, right</text>
    <text start="854.519" dur="7.01">I&amp;#39;m not supposed to give my opinion but give it a try and then you can tell me if it&amp;#39;s good or not</text>
    <text start="861.87" dur="7.729">Not convinced yet. Okay, I&amp;#39;ll cut you a deal the game is available for free and that&amp;#39;s a great price</text>
